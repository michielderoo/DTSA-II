    <td> <strong><em>DTSA-II</strong></em> is a graphical user interface for the
      <strong><em>EPQ</em></strong> library. <strong><em>EPQ</em></strong> is a
      library of quantitative algorithms for electron probe microanalysis.
      <strong><em>EPQ</em></strong> was developed by the <em>Microanalysis
      Group</em> at the <em>National Institute of Standards and Technology</em>
      to provide the microanalysis community with a standardized set of
      quantification algorithms. It is a platform on which the basics have been
      implemented so as a community we can push the state-of-the-art in
      microanalysis forward. It is designed as a library so that it can be
      readily integrated into more sophisticated
applications.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td><strong><em>EPQ</em></strong> has been developed in the <em>Java</em> language
for portability - it can run on many <em>Linux</em>, <em>Unix</em> (including
<em>Apple OSX</em>) and <em>Microsoft Windows</em> computers. The source code is
freely available to all. This is important. As a scientific community is it critical
that we say precisely how our data is processed. While most researchers won't want
to carefully study the quantitative algorithms within the <strong><em>EPQ</em></strong>
library, they should feel confident that if there is ever a question they can go
back to the source code and see precisely how the algorithm is implemented.
<strong><em>EPQ</em></strong> is not a black box that asks to be trusted blindly.
